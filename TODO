- Add some unit tests

- Deduplicate results (perhaps given a group differing only by ID,
  return just the one with the highest ID?)

- Warn or error on invalid query parameters.  Right now these are
  silently ignored (including misspellings; i.e. 'directoin=DSC'
  has no effect)

- Better validation for the csv import process (report on no. lines
  imported; no. invalid lines; etc.)
