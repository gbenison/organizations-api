A sample flask application demonstrating querying a simple database
with basic filtering and ordering exposed by an API

Dependencies
------------

python >= 2.7
flask
sqlite3

Setup
-----

1) Build the database

There must be a file named "organization_sample_data.csv" with the following format -
ï»¿id,name,city,state,postal,category
1,Michigan Science Center ,Detroit,MI,48202,Non-Profit
...

Import it with the following command:

  sqlite3 < import.sqlite

2) Start the API service

  FLASK_APP=app.py flask run

Usage
-----

curl localhost:5000


To do
-----
- Add some unit tests

- Deduplicate results (perhaps given a group differing only by ID,
  return just the one with the highest ID?)

- Warn or error on invalid query parameters.  Right now these are
  silently ignored (including misspellings; i.e. 'directoin=DSC'
  has no effect)

- Better validation for the csv import process (report on no. lines
  imported; no. invalid lines; etc.)
